## What is GPT4All ?

GPT4All is an exceptional language model, designed and developed by Nomic-AI, a proficient company dedicated to natural language processing. The app uses Nomic-AI's advanced library to communicate with the cutting-edge GPT4All model, which operates locally on the user's PC, ensuring seamless and efficient communication.

If you are interested in learning more about this groundbreaking project, visit their [Github repository](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all), where you can find comprehensive information regarding the app's functionalities and technical details. Moreover, you can delve deeper into the training process and database by going through their detailed Technical report, available for download at [Technical report](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.nomic.ai/gpt4all/2023_GPT4All_Technical_Report.pdf).

One of the app's impressive features is that it allows users to send messages to the chatbot and receive instantaneous responses in real-time, ensuring a seamless user experience. Additionally, the app facilitates the exportation of the entire chat history in either text or JSON format, providing greater flexibility to the users.

It's worth noting that the model has recently been launched, and it's expected to evolve over time, enabling it to become even better in the future. This webui is designed to provide the community with easy and fully localized access to a chatbot that will continue to improve and adapt over time.

## Installation

To install the app, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the GitHub repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all-ui
```

### Manual setup
Hint: Scroll down for docker-compose setup

1.  Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd gpt4all-ui
```

2.  Run the appropriate installation script for your platform:

On Windows :
```cmd
install.bat
```
- On Linux

```bash
bash ./install.sh
```

- On Mac os

```bash
bash ./install-macos.sh
```

On Linux/MacOS, if you have issues, refer more details are presented [here](docs/Linux_Osx_Install.md)
These scripts will create a Python virtual environment and install the required dependencies. It will also download the models and install them.

Now you're ready to work!

## Usage
For simple newbies on Windows:
```cmd
run.bat
```

For simple newbies on Linux/MacOsX:
```bash
bash run.sh
```

if you want more control on your launch, you can activate your environment:

On Windows:
```cmd
env/Scripts/activate.bat
```

On Linux/MacOs:
```cmd
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now you are ready to customize your Bot.

To run the Flask server, execute the following command:
```bash
python app.py [--port PORT] [--host HOST] [--temp TEMP] [--n-predict N_PREDICT] [--top-k TOP_K] [--top-p TOP_P] [--repeat-penalty REPEAT_PENALTY] [--repeat-last-n REPEAT_LAST_N] [--ctx-size CTX_SIZE]
```

On Linux/MacOS more details are [here](docs/Linux_Osx_Usage.md)


## Options
*   `--model`: the name of the model to be used. The model should be placed in models folder (default: gpt4all-lora-quantized.bin)
*   `--seed`: the random seed for reproductibility. If fixed, it is possible to reproduce the outputs exactly (default: random)
*   `--port`: the port on which to run the server (default: 9600)
*   `--host`: the host address on which to run the server (default: localhost)
*   `--temp`: the sampling temperature for the model (default: 0.1)
*   `--n-predict`: the number of tokens to predict at a time (default: 128)
*   `--top-k`: the number of top-k candidates to consider for sampling (default: 40)
*   `--top-p`: the cumulative probability threshold for top-p sampling (default: 0.90)
*   `--repeat-penalty`: the penalty to apply for repeated n-grams (default: 1.3)
*   `--repeat-last-n`: the number of tokens to use for detecting repeated n-grams (default: 64)
*   `--ctx-size`: the maximum context size to use for generating responses (default: 2048)

Note: All options are optional, and have default values.

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:9600 (or http://your host name:your port number if you have selected different values for those) to access the chatbot UI. To use the app, open a web browser and navigate to this URL.

Make sure to adjust the default values and descriptions of the options to match your specific application.

### Docker Compose Setup
Make sure to have the `gpt4all-lora-quantized-ggml.bin` inside the `models` directory.
After that you can simply use docker-compose or podman-compose to build and start the application:

Build
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
```

Start
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

After that you can open the application in your browser on http://localhost:9600

## Future Plans

Here are some of the future plans for this project:

**Enhanced control of chatbot parameters:** We plan to improve the user interface (UI) of the chatbot to allow users to control the parameters of the chatbot such as temperature and other variables. This will give users more control over the chatbot's responses, and allow for a more customized experience.

**Extension system for plugins:** We are also working on an extension system that will allow developers to create plugins for the chatbot. These plugins will be able to add new features and capabilities to the chatbot, and allow for greater customization of the chatbot's behavior.

**Enhanced UI with themes and skins:** Additionally, we plan to enhance the user interface of the chatbot to allow for themes and skins. This will allow users to personalize the appearance of the chatbot, and make it more visually appealing.

We are excited about these future plans for the project and look forward to implementing them in the near future. Stay tuned for updates!
